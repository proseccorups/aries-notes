# AMdEX
- AMdEX starts with any kind of organisation (airline, hospital)
- organisations collect all kinds of data
- other organisations could make use of that data
- the internet is scary. How do we share this data without danger
- is the data gdpr compliant
- Thieves can steal your data
- People can have bad intentions for your data (stealing customers, exposing you)
- AMdEX will be the data exchange that will enable safe exchanging of data
- Reasoner is an engine that watches what data can be accessed by whom and for what purpose. You configure it yourself using your own policies.
- A consortium (group of parties with common interest in dat sharing)
- Marketplace, data will be discoverable by other parties
- Orchestrator commutes all the components making sure only the allowed transactions take place
- With the data exchange you don't need to trust your partners. You just define the rules for sharing that data and the 
  AMdEX infrastructure will guarantee their enforcement.
