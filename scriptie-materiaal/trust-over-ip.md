# Trust over IP (ToIP)
Another term that one will come across quite often when dabbling themselves in the hyperledger SSI ecosystem, is Trust over IP.
ToIP is a set of protocols to enable trust on the internet and the governance frameworks that define how those protocols 
are used. ToIP also includes the identity part of SSI but is more broad in general. It covers any type of authentic data.

The governance structure mirrors the technical layers of a system by setting rules that everyone involved agrees to follow. 
These rules ensure that each layer of the system works both on its own and together with the others. 

- How participants use the blockchain to record and access information.
- How agents understand the messages they exchange during a process.
- The meaning of the information (claims) within digital credentials and how it's interpreted by the entity checking (verifying) it.
- The official capacity (authority) that allows an issuer to provide (issue) a digital credential.
- The technology isn't limited to just managing personal or organizational identities; it's also useful wherever it's crucial to 
  have trustworthy data. Here are some practical examples:

- Supply Chains: Many aspects of supply chains can benefit from using verifiable data. For instance, when an item moves from 
  one transporter to another, a digital credential can be created to record that change, which can later be used to confirm 
  (verify) the item's history or origin. This method can be applied to various products, from food to luxury items like diamonds.
- Regulatory Compliance: Traditional paper-based regulatory processes can be modernized using trustworthy digital data. 
  Instead of paper documents, digital credentials that are created at the source and can't be altered (immutable) could 
  serve as a more reliable way to document and verify compliance, providing a clear record of events.
- Government Applications: An example of this in action is from the Government of British Columbia. They've replaced paper 
  notebooks with digital data for mine inspections. Inspection data is collected digitally, stored in a database, and a 
  digital credential that certifies its authenticity is created. If needed, such as in a court case, these digital credentials 
  can be used to confirm the truth of the inspection reports.
